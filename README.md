Limitations found (Upstash should still be notified of this):

- I can't filter in a range query. This is a big limitation. It would be great if we can use the same filtering mechanism as we can using vector search
- You don't offer read replication yet. This would be incredibly beneficial
- For some reason, on vercel edge it's not that fast.
- If I put emojis in the data, it seems they are corrupted. I'd expect data to be stored as UTF8.
